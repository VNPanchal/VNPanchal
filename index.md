Welcome to my site

I study bacterial pathogenesis and investigate key factors for their suitability as a novel antibacterial drug targets. I apply various biophysical methods such as Isothermal calorimetry, fluorescence spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance, X-ray crystallography and develop some of them in high throughput format for compound screening. This is in combination with in-silico virtual screening and structure-based drug designing, aimed at designing novel and promising drug like lead molecules. 
Currently, I am investigating the potential of ncRNA as antibacterial drug target.
